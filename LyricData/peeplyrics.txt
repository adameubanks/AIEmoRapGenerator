SESH

Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker I'll be ready for him

Got your glass slippers on, lookin' like you're Cinderella
Girl, what you sippin' on? Room spinnin' like propellers
Boy, what you trippin' on?, I will make these pussies jealous
Watch your girl sing along, say she want an acappella
I could give you want you want 'til my body in the mud
King of the fuckin' swamp, name a drug, I got the plug
Shawty say my house is haunted, I say I don't give a fuck
Somethin's watchin' over me, see me smoke a million (SESH)
Drunk kickin', dutch lickin', he said he can't fuck with me
Fuck this and fuck with me, I'ma take your luck with me
Bitch, what the fuck it do? TeamSESH drippin' on the 1s and the 2s
Fuck your crew and and fuck you too
Edge of the swamp, know the truck go through

Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker I'll be ready for him


I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'

I will always be here for you
And when I'm dyin' I pray to a higher power next to you Is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor?
I'm feelin' naughty I wish to explore your features secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice
My only option, watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine
I'll fuckin' kill you, take you back to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find
My little angel, in your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got no where to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got 'till I'm gone
And that's a promise, unless you didn't want it then for you I'd be dishonest

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'


I know that it hurts sometimes, but It's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wan' see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feeling philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, will you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
Comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room


You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch I'm tatted out my shirt so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed
I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why

Ohhhh, I don't think I can take this anymore
Noooo, washing the blood from my wrist on the floor
Ohhhh, fuck is you talkin' bout my shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole for eternity so they can reap what they sow
Ohhhh, I don't think I can do nothing but flow
Noooo, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Ohhhh, I don't know why you in love with me hoe
I keep amphetamines up in my coat
I'm in the zone, I'm all on my own

You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch I'm tatted out my shirt so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed
I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why


I got a feeling that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So lets laugh a little 'fore I'm gone
I've been dreaming of this shit for awhile now
Got me high now
She don't love me but she's singing my song
Oh no
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back and a bullet in my brain
I'm clinically insane
Walking home alone I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it getting high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now I'm so high I be fucking with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the morning with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me

Running away from me but I'm not giving up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me but I'm not giving up on you no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things


Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowing Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasing bitches, I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at 'em like I never even knew them at all
I remember walking around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I tell there's something that I couldn't recall
Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself but I'm already in hell for

You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You weren't there
(Skrrt)

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowing Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasing bitches, I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at 'em like I never even knew them at all

Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself but I'm already in hell for it


I remember when you used to hold me close and say you love me
Now you acting like a ghost and that's okay I know I'm ugly
Now I'm swerving in the ghost and I'm okay I'm getting money
Now I'm switching up the coast, get out my way I stop for nothing
Give me some time and give me your patience
Came in the game last one month, fuck the game I'm done
Give me a sign and I'm going to take it
Whatever way I want
Bitch I get payed up front
I'm getting mine so fuck all your placements
Baby face I'm done
Fuck the place I'm from
Don't hit my line and say something basic
If it ain't about the money
Please don't waste no time
Looking out the edge, and I'm picturing the fall
I don't want to break my legs and have to carry on
If I carry on I'm gon' need some marijuana
Put it in my bong then I make another song


Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers

Don't stutter, slang from the gutter, gotta' bang for ya' butter
Got my name from my mother
No other, shining thru' the shutter
Say she over me, whatever cause she underneath my cover
Bet you wish you had my flow
I know I'm dope, I could ask your hoe
Bet you wish you got me mad, you don't, you won't, not never,
Stop blowing up my phone

You wanna run that shit back for me?

Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers


I use to dream of you
Na,I use to lose my sleep for you
But now I see right through
And everybody wanna fuck with me
But I'on fuck witchu
I use to scream at you
I use to turn my cheek at you
But now I need you too
And everybody give a fuck bout me
And I ain't nothing to you
I'm just looking at my life while it go down the drain
I got pain in my brain,But I don't never complain
I'm insane I'm deranged,I see your face at the rain
This ain't no race for the fame,But at this pace I'ma make it
Face it,you basic, Lil Peep you're replacement
I'm taking your spot
I'll give it back when I'm raking the gwap
Maybe not
I keep on checking statements
I'm checking for payments
While you checking ya plays bitch

I been doing my own thing lately
I been holdin my own thing for safety
I don't pick up the phone till they pay me
They  asking me how it feel,I say it's crazy
[x2]


When I'm coming down
The lights will brighten
And the noise rings in my head
Did I let you down again..

If I leave here now
It won't feel right
With somebody else in my bed
And I'm breaking down again..

But if I need to go
Just to show you I don't fucking care
If you don't give a shit bout me at all
You little bitch, that's cool with me
So act like you don't know
And I won't fucking stare at anybody else
The way I do, when it's only me and you..

You notice me [x4]
You know its me [x4]

It's me

My arms are searching for you
My arms are stretched out towards you
I feel you on my finger tips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you


Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I'm growing so tired of this
How do you fight the feeling
How do you fight the feeling bitch
She calling my phone
She calling my phone I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone girl
I'm all on my own
I'm all on my own
I know you ain't high as this
Putting my mind to shit
Give me some time I be flying bitch
Breaking my bones
You breaking my bones you want me to line my wrist
I ain't gon' do it for you
I'm gon' do it for me cause it help me forget
I ain't go put up no time
If you ain't got time if I ain't gon' bitch
I'm doing my thing
and bitch I can see all the disrespect in front of my face
Step in this bitch let these hoes feel my drip
If you ain't smoking on something imo dip
Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I'm growing so tired of this
How do you fight the feeling
How do you fight the feeling bitch
She calling my phone
She calling my phone I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone girl

When you are on your own
Just know that I need you
I wont pick up the phone
Just know that I need you


Laying on my back now
Lay another track down
Brought the Black cats out, bad luck
If you wanna snap now, tryna take a cap now
Bring the black cats out, now you're fucked
Watch out for the pigs while I ride real slow
Smoking thracks, read my tats from the backseat
Why you throwing shade like you finna face me
You were always bitch, need a Maxi
Half of your pussy blood dripping down your skinny's
I could serve you for some 20's but my racks free
Young bitch I got plenty in my bottle it say Remy on my belt
That shit say Fetti in the back, green (bling)

Got me talking bout my clothes girl
When I fall won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb cause they give me all their brains

Put me on the map now
I could hold a map down
See me in the background
Rolling up
I don't gotta rap loud
Bitch I got that trap sound
Autotune my strap with the Cobra Clutch
Watch out for the bitch in the black Range Rover
Driving fast when she listening to Max B
Got the tats on her ass and the black ski mask in the back
If you tryna get your ass beat
One for the money blow
Two for the show my flow go perfect with a sad beat
Everywhere I go all I ever see is snow
In the summertime pussy make me happy

Got me talking bout my clothes girl
Won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins


Damn son, where'd you find this?

Screamin' on my mind
And it's so fine
Make her frumpet cry
If I take my time
And replace my crime
Get my face recognised
We can do anything
Worth, greed, memory
One day I'll be sober too
One day I'll be over you
Screamin' on my mind
And it's so fine
Make a grown man cry cry
If I take my time
And replace my crime
While I make my rhymes
I can do anything
I can be anything
Anything I wanna be
I can never be a wanna be


Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death
Grab my knife find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice put the blame on you

(Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death)
Grab my knife find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice then its shame on u

Where did you go this time
What if I lose my mind
What if I make you cry
What if I die
What if I end my fucking life


I'mma take my time when I'm in it
I'mma make my mind up by tonight
No I can't die when I'm singing
I could live forever, way past the mic

These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passing by, no one noticed my angel wings
Getting high cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why, I might sing you a symphony
These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passing by, no one noticed my angel wings
Getting high cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why, I might sing you a symphony


I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall
Money getting tall and tall and tall
I know I'mma ball, mirror on the wall
I could make it all and all and all
I ain't picking up a call, mirror on the wall

I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall


[Lil Peep:]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down

Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up, we'll leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down
She said she ain't never coming back
She ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back bitch
Now they wanna put me on a track
Can't put me on a track
Can I put u on my tracklist?
I'd rather watch you bleed to death
(I'd rather watch you bleed to death)
Than..
See you leave just like the rest..
(See you leave just like the rest..)
Damn..

[Yung Goth:]
Lately, I've been dying lately

Lately, lately..

I've been dying lately, lately, lately

Always tryna blame me
You ain't tryna save me
Save me, lately
Gettin high, tasty
Now I'm on that same shit
I've been dying lately
Lately, baby

[Lil Peep:]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down


[Lil Skil:]
I can see it in your eyes, that u wanna get high
I can see it in your eyes, that u need it right now
How you need it right now
How you wanna get high
How you need it right now
How you wanna good bye..

[Lil Skil & Lil Peep:]
I just wanna hear a sign from the narrow side of town
Baby we grillin' right now (woah)
Yeah I just wanna feel alive, baby take your time
Smoking on the spot (woah)

[Lil Peep:]
Girl you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss then we fuckin'
I just can't get enough
Put it on me that's the best part baby the trust
Trust me
I got nothing for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie till the sun came up
All the places that you took me no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me now they on my nuts


My time is here and I'm making it clear
Oh I love you my dear
But I'm going, I'm gone
I might come back when the Benz all black
Ten racks on my lap
If I don't relapse and I stay strong
I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die I'mma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time but I never wanna do that again
Nothing worse than losing a friend
And the feeling you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waiting for a wave and I'll drown
Satan letting me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No I'm not gonna hurt you girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free
All you gonna get from me
Little bit a love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it all


I been spending time
Time after time
Tryna get my mind right
But I just find I been lyin
Lying to myself
I don't need your help
I been just fine on my own
Baby I could handle mine
I could multiply..
I could satisfy..
Anybody tryn' see me shine
Man that's just the way I grind
I been on my grind
You been on my line
That's the reason why
I been working hard
You could stand aside
I could never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe
I can never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe

That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe [x2]

I'll be good, I don't care
My whole life sucks anyway
I could feel it in the air today
I'll be fine on my own
I got no where left to go
But you got no one left to turn to now
Will you cry when you die and there's no one by your side
And your bedroom walls are burning down
Or will you take your stand tonight
Get your ass away from that light
One more try you'll be just fine
Do what's right, baby drop that knife
I don't wanna watch you bleed
I don't wanna watch you leave
(baby I'll leave too)
I could never live my dream
I would never live my dream
(baby I need you)


Ice in your veins
Blood in your brain

And I thought I should say
That I still love u like I did back in two thousand and eight
Okay

You don't ever listen to the shit that I say

Smoking on some loud

I'ma give ya bitch a ounce for free..


Baby I could give u the moon
You know he can't do what I do
Yeah It's true
Girl I think I'm dying real soon
We could die in my room
Me and you
Ima keep you in mind
While I drive right by
Say goodbye to the nice guy
I'm wasting my time
Giving you rhymes
You gotta give me a dime
Before I do that again
And I ain't trippin I'm high
In the trunk of the Benz
Is where my women reside
Where my women will die
I ain't got no friends
And I don't listen to y'all
I'm equipped for the fall
And the winter and all
When the summer come
I'ma have enough to get the fuck out
I could buy a truck and
Drive that motherfuckin truck out (skrr)
Trying to buy luck
If you don't die that means you lucked out
I ain't tryna fuck
I see the moon and bug the fuck out

[Lil Peep:]
Why you always tryna spend my money?
Why you always gotta act so funny?

I can't feel that much sometimes
These drugs could kill me
Disappear into my mind where I can't feel a thing
When the sky falls down, no one here can think that clearly
I'll be by your side, let's get high one last time

I don't wanna stop now, I don't wanna stop now
But I gotta leave it alone
Is it cause I'm hot now, it's probably cause I'm hot now
Bitch you better leave me alone
First I cut you off then I cut you down
Shit go off, when I come around
I don't never come around
Bitch I'm getting hunnids' now

She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately
Girl you drive me crazy, AMG Mercedes
Speeding down the highway, looking at the street lights
Geeking on a Friday, I can never sleep right
Knowing I hurt you, I don't deserve you

But I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I wanna die too, we all wanna die too
I got this vibe I swear she love getting high to
I love getting high too, I wanna hide you

I remember when you used to hold my hand
Now you acting like a ghost girl
Live forever with a smile stuck on your face
You think he know you but I know you the most, girl
You will never find another one just like me
Long nights getting high on the coast, girl
Two weeks and I still got the same old jeans on
Never got a girl when I need one

I see your face when I look out the window
I think about her every time that I sniff blow
If you love me, hit me up on the flip phone
I'm dying, I don't think that my bitch know

Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same

Today is gonna be the day that I'm gonna come back to you
I know, I did a little blow and I never wrote back to you
My love, I wanna give it all to you
Baby I just wanna ball with you
I could see the air was coming near the way I do
About you now

Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same


[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal:]
Running up that hill, you pushin' me back
Think that I can make you want it bad
I don't need it though
(I don't need it though)

Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? Because I don't know (I dunno)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like so alive
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
Fore me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It's the way, it is the way it really seem
There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one
Some passing on and out
(And out, and out)
It wasn't something that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt

[Lil Peep:]
It wasn't something that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt
I just really wanna talk to you again
That's how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end
It wasn't something 'til you brought it up
I knew that you were trying to make it out
Without a single scar, clawing at my arm
I saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start
Bring me down, it's not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
I remember you were climbing on top of me
Why you acting like you fucking forgot me?
I've been dreaming about a place out in Hollywood
Tell my mama that I'm moving to Hollywood


Jugging on a Friday, but I saw you on the freeway (Skrrt)
I can not forget that face, I don't even know your name
I'm in love with a ghost girl, all alone in a lonely world
I just really wanna find her, I'ma do another line first

Lying on the asphalt, Lil Peep blacked out
Fucking with the coatway, let my Mad Max out
I be on some real shit, get it from my OG
I don't wanna hear shit, shawty what she told me
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I be on my lonely
Looking for the right girl, why you all up on me?
Love me for a night, girl, hate me in the morning
Yeah I know your type girl, so I make her blow me
Lil Peep

Look me in my eyes, girl
Tell me if you think that it's a lie, girl
Getting tired of your girl
I know I need my own girl, my girl
[x2]

Jugging on a Friday, but I saw you on the freeway (Skrrt)
I can not forget that face, I don't even know your name
I'm in love with a ghost girl, all alone in a lonely world
I just really wanna find her, I'ma do another line first


[Lil Peep:]
I just wanna see you smile, I just wanna make you mine
We can spend time, smoke away the time
We can go anywhere you ever wanted
Anything you ever dreamed
I can make your dreams come true
I'll be on my own, no crew
Out here making these moves
Singing these big city blues
I don't wanna think about you
Every time I think about you
I swear I fall in love again
I remember everything you said
Promise me it's real
Girl, I got a deal
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Promise me it's real
Girl, I got a deal
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Coldhart

[Coldhart:]
And we can leave this club
And we can get fucked up
In the back of the Chevy
Girl, I felt your heart beating heavy for me
And I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you got stars for eyes
And she sweet like Texas tea
With a ass from Tennessee
And we can take the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna see you go
Sitting drinking whiskey, hoping that you miss me
Baby say you do (please say you do)
Maybe say you do


Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts
[x2]

Love now, cry later, cry later
But I always take the chance
But I always take the chance
If I could save her
If I could save her
She said she got other plans, damn

Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts

Little Bo Peep
Been in the same old jeans

[Lil Peep:]
I've been popping pills, I've been trying to forget about you
But honestly, I've got regrets about you
Baby, it's over now, you're gonna cry all night
I'm gonna smile at you when I see you and pretend that I'm alright

I'm never sober now, I'm getting high all night
I'm about to put this in my system to erase you from my mind

[Horse Head:]
I was in lust with you
Thought that I loved you but I got the two confused
I don't wanna fall asleep with you in my head and I know that
You regret some things you said
But honestly, I have regrets about you

Teen romance
Give me this dance
Yeah, I took a xan (yeah)

Let me guide you to a place where
No one hurts you, you are safe here with me
(With me, with me)

Let me down just like my drug
Call my plug

Looking at the ground while she suck my blood
Baby let me down just like my drug
I can see a frown when I call my plug
I ain't off that brown but I love my mud
[x2]

And she don't know shit 'bout me
And she ain't getting nothing but some dick out me
She be in the club, without me
But that's okay, she always pick out me

I be in The Bay, I be in LA
I be on stage, bitches kissing on my face
What I'm tryin to say
Let's take it by the day
I'm the one you want, not the one you trying to save
I got a broken heart, you were like a blade
Tearing me apart, but I kinda like the pain
She like it when it rain
She like that I'm insane
I like it that she gay
She like me for my brain
Lil Bo Peep

Girl, you don't know my name

[Lil Tracy:]
True Religion jeans, pockets full of cocaine
Tattoos on my face, I'mma die this way
I don't wanna talk, so I flex and I finesse
Only inhale the best, exhale the stress
Used to be broke, I cast a spell on my check
Ice on my neck, now my ex sends me texts
Ask me if I still love her, I'm on xans, I forget
Bitch, did you forget? You cut through me like a wrist
I'm finna get rich, snortin' coke in a Benz
You don't know my name, you don't know my pain
On the highway to hell in a Beamer, switchin' lanes
Six hundred sixty six kisses on your face
Baby, now that I'm gone, do you hallucinate?
And see me in your room with that Gucci on my waist?
I'm so far away, now I'm in L.A
Gothic bitch, skinny waist, pussy drippin' like cocaine

[Lil Peep:]

[Slug Christ:]
She talkin' got me soddin' in shame, girl, you drive me insane
Only you can occupy any space in my heart and in my brain
I fade away in saturated gray
It's just one way to numb it all away
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain killer
Snort it all away for a second, I'll feel better
Fake ass bitches plottin' on a Young Slugger
Diamorphine and I'm self medicatin', yeah
See different, you said you felt the same
Girl, I thought you knew my pain


[LiL Peep:]
Watch me fall from these castle walls
I'll stand tall, baby, watch me ball
Call after call, walk around the mall
I'll cop it all, castle halls

[Lil Tracy:]
Baby, I'm an asshole, walkin' thru my castle
I can break your heart, baby, I know it's so fragile
Step inside my castle, we blowin' on that good dope
Put this in your nostril, baby, I got good blow
Fuck her, then I vanish, disappear like magic
I live lavish, Gucci sheets all on my mattress
Goth Boy Clique, skrrt skrrt in a black whip
Pullin' down her skirt, I know you want it, you can't have it
Welcome to my castle, it's just me and you tonight
I think you're an angel, just a human in disguise
This is not rap, it's a goth lullaby
I'll be in your dreams every time that we get high
Lie, lie, lie, all you ever do is lie
Look me in my eyes like the stars in the sky
Grew up in the mud in a castle, I'ma die
Grew up in the mud in a castle, I'ma die

[LiL Peep:]
Watch me fall from these castle walls
I'll stand tall, baby watch me ball
Call after call, walk around the mall

[Lil Tracy:]

She said she love me she don't even know my real name
Hoppin' out the Uber on a Friday
Gothic bitch, her Gucci bag got bags of cocaine
I've been living life my way
I can't fuck with you if we weren't friends on Myspace
Lord why, Lord why do I wanna die?
I'mma get a Maserati just to take my life inside

You got blood on your poor hands
I just wanted to help, now I'm going to hell
Walk away as the door slams

[Lil Tracy:]
I know you wanna Facetime, baby I have Samsung
When I met your mom, she told me I was handsome
You told me I'm sexy, do you still think that?
You told me that you loved me, do you still think that?

Ounce of the kush, blowing smoke out your window

Step inside the club, cameras flashing in my eyes

Pull up Fly Away on the bitch
Shout out Kirb
Shout out to Raven

Blood on my teeth, don't be walkin' down my street
I be in the dark, white bitch never eat
I be in the dark, white bitch never sleep
Pull up in a park and these bitches look at me (look at Peep)
Brick walls, ain't nobody getting in now
Fake friends, they don't wanna see me win now
Deep water, they don't wanna see me swim now
Water on my wrist, castle for my bitch now

[Lil Tracy:]
I dropped out of school, but that money comin' in
My mouth full of jewels, she like it when I grin
Tracy the prince, sippin' champagne inside of the Lyft
My castle big, I'm sorry girl but you can't come in
Lil Peep why, why do they hate?
My bitch so bad, told that bitch to behave
I run it up, they wanna see me crawl
All they do is talk, please get off my balls (yuh)
Brick walls, ain't nobody gettin' in now
The moons out, I feel like myself again now
Fuck you, fuck her, and fuck them
If I die today you would try to fuck my bitch

[Lil Peep:]
All this stress
Look at this mess
Look at my head, I'm better off dead
Dyin' out west
Tryin' my best
Layin' in bed, I was comin' down then
No more pain, locked away
I go insane
I'm so insane
In my brain everyday, I go insane
I'm so insane
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight

[Lil Tracy:]
Look in the mirror
I see a demon, I'm barely breathing
My shadow is bleeding
On the highway, baby, I'm speeding
I'm leavin' the city, you should be with me
Two weeks with the same old jeans on
I know you want to die, baby, this is your theme song
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on

[Lil Peep:]

Black fur, black coat
Gothboiclique in the back hoe
Switchblades, cocaine
Gothboiclique till my soul take
Black jeans, half black hoes
Gothboiclique in the castle

[Lil Tracy:]
In high school I was a loner
I was a reject, I was a poser
Multiple personalities, I'm bipolar
I swear I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on

[Lil Peep:]
When I die bury me with all my ice on

Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

Left my world behind for you
I just hope you find the truth inside of you
Left the drugs behind for you
I can't help you make it through, that's what I do
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Go

[Lil Tracy:]
Here we go again, wakin' up again
I know a lot of shit, but I don't know what day it is
I really like you, but I'ma die fast
So you should run away, and don't look back
Castle love, bloodstained rug
My face tatted up baby I don't give a fuck
Back of the club switchblade tucked
Vampire mix the champagne with the blood
I was wide awake, you were havin' a nightmare
You said you think that you're in Hell, I'll catch a flight there
I'll be right there, for you
Castle love, bloodstained rug
My face tatted up, baby, I don't give a fuck

Speeding away, the city in the rear view
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
Goth Boi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies and gems
You can have all of them

Every fucking kind of abuse

If you love me too,
You would give me you
Lock me in your room,
Don't tell me the truth

Everything you said,
Stayed inside my head
All the shit you said
All the blood I bled

16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I try to go, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wasting your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind, I been on my own since age nine

16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I try to go, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wasting your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind, I been on my own since age nine

I been on my own for two nights, I been in my zone of being high
Now she wonder why do I lie, I can't tell my wrongs from my right
Is anybody out there? (is anybody out there)
Can anybody hear me? (can anybody hear me)

Is anybody out there? (is anybody out there)
Can anybody hear me? (can anybody hear me)

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Runaway, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

Drugs and guitars, I'm a real rockstar

[Fish Narc:]
Rock stars, punk stars
Equal flourish
Dirty laundry on the floor
Two guitars in my bed
Sleep with me each night and my best friend
But take heed, take warning as not to copy
'Cause you'll find the results sound weak
Goodnight


Jeez, la, la, la

B-B-Bis Los on the track, boy

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds are that loud, like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepards (Kiki Shepards)
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You-you could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (For sure)
She can not keep your cool, and you let her (and you let her)
I could keep my cool while I'm eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

I could I could-I could, uh, uh

I could keep my cool under pressure like a fool (like a fool)
Eatin' lemon pepper, with a lepper playin' pool
Damn, my man a Cheetah, no, my man a cougar
I don't put tobacco in my motherfuckin' hookah
Straight sativa, motherfuck a Dutch
Motherfuck a twenty gram doobie with a crutch
When it come to that stuff, I can not get enough
So I'm strictly smokin' wax , 'cause that kush gettin' tax, damn
Catch me smokin' dabs with your dad, why you mad, bitch?
Sad boys, money gain, I need me a sad bitch
My life, ain't lavish, I ain't ever had a shit
I'm quick to take that dollar from your wallet if you had it
I be playin' Madden, smokin' weed and rappin'
Ain't no haters 'round him, on my thrown laughin'
Lil Peep spazzin', skeetin' on your mattress
Creepin' through the night time, blood on my classics

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds are that loud, like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepards (Kiki Shepards)
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (For sure)
She can not keep your cool, and you let her (and you let her)
I could keep my cool while I'm eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

I could-I could, I could-I could

She said, "Why you got so many tattoos?"
So when your daddy see me out, he know I'm bad news
She said, "Why you always wear them black boots?"
'Cause the blood don't show, hoe
I can not, and I will not ever be stuck
It's just a short amount of time before your somethin' is nothin'
You've gotta do what you can't do, 'fore the puffin'
Gon' have to end the discussion, I hear the police comin'
I could smell them from a block away, aroma like bacon
They'd be jealous of the dirty money you would be lickin'
So then they point their finger blamin' but the judge is distinctive
What's that money for the takin' 'cause I witnessed them take it
But you ain't got no damn wallet, just a pocket of dust
And the lawyer they provided you will quickly choke up
And what you gon' do then, spend your life in the pen'
Because the cops are corrupt, are you gon' call up your man?

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds are that loud, like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepards (Kiki Shepards)
I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (Twice the effort)
She can not keep your cool, and you let her (Let her)
I could keep my cool while I'm eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

Pepper
Twice the effort, under pressure
Twice the effort, under pressure

In high school I was a loner

Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on
Witchcraft, love chants

You told me I'm sexy, do you still think that?
You told me you loved me, do you still think that?
3AM, climbin' through your window
Ounce of the kush, blowin' smoke out your window
You're a thousand miles away, I snort a thousand lines
Step inside the club, cameras flashin’ in my eyes

She's trying to find the...

She's trying to find the words
I'm trying to find this girl
But it's so dark and I was under club lights

Call me on my iphone
I don't pick it up much
I've been losing friends, I don't feel right

4 Gold Chains, gave 2 to my brothers
Fame bring pain, but the pain make money
Keep it 100 baby girl what's your number?
Girls numb the pain and the drugs get me numb-er

I need 4 whips so I can give em to my brothers
I need 4 cribs so I can give em to my mother

4 Gold Chains, gave 2 to my brothers


I had a plan to kill
Myself and you for real
With my gun, I'll take your life
I'm no fun without my knife

If I I want to I will cut you, I will make you feel my pain
If I need to I will bleed you, I will make you go insane
When the time comes I will sacrifice my love in the moonlight
Whenever I cum I feel half as nice as I did when it's you, right


Ain't nobody ever told you how I love you
Nobody ever told you how I feel about you
Okay, I admit I wanna fuck you
But it doesn't change the way I feel about you
I been by myself for a long time
I just wish that I could know if I was on your mind
Running out of time
I just wish that I could know if you were by my side
On the day I die, would you even cry?
If I end my life, would you hold me tight then?

[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal (Døves):]
You'll only see us in the back
GothBoiClique, all black
I knew love once, it's hard to forget
I thought of you and nights spent
When I'm backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss 2013 love songs
(And I'm so lost), under club lights
(In the all black), GothBoiClique

[Lil Peep:]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs

[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal (Døves):]
(Fucked up in the back of the club)
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
(I got scars on me, no love)
Light a candle and I pray for doves
(And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue)
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
(I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood)
(It's so fucked)
So tell me what is love
(If I ever had it), if I ever had it
(Did I really want it?)
(And why can't I remember?)
I cannot remember
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard
(It's a slow drug)
And I swear that
(But it's true love)
These are true lines

[Døves:]
Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing
Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me
Screamin', "Why don't you love me back?"
'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse

[Lil Peep:]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs


[Lil Peep:]
Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me
I don't wanna talk, I don't need friends
I'ma get a Benz, will you love me 'til the end?

Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me
I don't wanna talk, I don't need friends
I'ma get a Benz, will you love me 'til the end?

[Lil Tracy:]
I know you love xans, but there is no way you forgot about the way that I held your hand
Should we try again, give it another chance
I don't think it's worth it, I don't think it's worth it
Pouring red wine in a chalice
I sip slow, can't spill it on my fabric
You're like a switchblade, cut right through me
I kinda like it though, baby, cut through me
Vampire in the club in the back now
Heartthrob girls have me as their background
I don't care though, I want you to care though
I cast a love spell, baby, you'll be back though

[Lil Peep:]
Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me
I don't wanna talk, I don't need friends
I'ma get a Benz, will you love me 'til the end?

Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat

Baby call me up, tryna fuck
Cause she know I'm finna get the Benz truck
Good luck mothafucka
I was in the cut gettin sucked from another bitch
Pop another bean, had to double up my cup and shit
Call me up tryna fuck
Cause she know that I've been gettin' to the bucks
Good luck mothafucka
Back of the club, fucked up on some other shit
All I ever wanted was a Benz and a bad bitch

All I ever wanted was a friend
All I ever wanted was a brand new Benz truck
Now I wonder where my friends gon' end up
Money don't help with the pain, where the drugs at?
Make a few racks, call the plug back
She like baby, where you goin'? When you comin' back?
I'ma be away for a month
When I get back we can fuck
I'ma be away for a lifetime
Everything I say at the right time
Givin girls cocaine, white wine
Everyone afraid of my lifestyle

Baby call me up, tryna fuck
Cause she know I'm finna get the Benz truck
Good luck mothafucka
I was in the cut gettin' sucked from another bitch
Pop another bean, had to double up my cup and shit
Call me up tryna fuck
Cause she know that I've been gettin' to the bucks
Good luck mothafucka
Back of the club, fucked up on some other shit
All I ever wanted was a Benz and a bad bitch

Main bitch wilding, pussy in my diet
Lie me down in bed, got my side bitch crying, trying

Can't you tell that I'm lying?

Everything you said to me was at the perfect time

She crying diamonds

Bitch I'm shining

It's alright to tell me
What you think about me
I won't try to argue
Or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving
You must have your reasons
The season is calling
Your pictures are falling down

The steps that I retrace
The sad look on your face
The timing and structure
Did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing
When I move I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up

And maybe I'll see you
At a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by
On the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave
We'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last
When he's gone, I won't come back

And it'll happened once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own
Well, I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up


[Lil Peep:]
I don't give a fuck how you feeling about me
Back of the club, bad bitches around me
Back in the day why everyone doubt me
Look at my outfit, somebody count me
Choke on my dick if you're trying to shade me
I don't give a fuck if you're trying to play me
I don't give a fuck if you're trying to save me
Yeah I got bitches not one of them date me

[Eddy Baker:]
Know I pulled up with a box of blunts
Range Rover filled with sluts
Shoe box filled with blunts
Rolling up that stinky skunk
Light it up, they know what's up
Getting money with my bros
Bad bitches they show us love
Hit the crib and let us fuck
Came in sober leaving drunk
Young nigga I'm having fun
Lean in my hawwiian punch
Drank too much I'm throwing up
All my shows be going up
That's why your girl be choosing us
[?]
My life like Ferris Bueller [?]
Posted in the breakfast club
Just like [?] smoking drugs
Where's my molly we're gon try and see if she fuck with a thug
Healthyboyz cartel
Got narcotics if you need a buzz
Blowing all my money on designer cause I'm young and dumb


Everybody wanna ride around town with me
Making money ride around downtown with me
Everyone wanna ride around town with Peep

I be in the backseat smoking on thraxx
Can I have some cash please? You don't gotta ask
You don't gotta ask me, she don't gotta ask
Still yelling free Max B, Free Gucci
Fuck me in the backseat baby make it last
I remember last week came too fast
Lil Peep nasty scratches on the back
But I got racks and she loving on my tats
Making money back

Everyone wanna ride around town with me
Making money ride around downtown with me
Everyone wanna ride around town with Peep

I be in the backseat smoking on thraxx
Can I have some cash please? You don't gotta ask
You don't gotta ask me, she don't gotta ask
Still yelling free Max B
Free Gucci
Fuck me in the backseat baby make it last
I remember last week came too fast
Lil Peep nasty scratches on the back
But I got racks and she loving on my tats
Making money back


[Lil Peep:]
I'll be right here, when you step out the car
I see you from afar, but I know who you are
I know exactly who you are, what you're looking for
I know exactly where it starts, and I'm not looking forward to the end
Because we're not gonna last
Because we took it too fast, and that's a good way to crash and burn
What I learned, I don't like taking my turn
If she mine, she gon' be mine until we ash in an urn
Let me burn, let me swerve, let me pull up on the curb
Now I'm looking so absurd, But I'm all that they heard, at the party pull-up rari
Up in the haze on the scene up in the haze on the scene
Light a hundred fuckin' dutchs and then I follow my dreams
Girl you're fuckin with Lil Peep, I'm the king of the teens
I just dropped a couple singles and take over the scene
Got the internet buzzing, 20 thousand a week
Now I practice getting pussy, I practice all that I preach
Peep

[Gizmo:]
I'll be right there when you need me close
I'll always be around when you need me the most
But I know, that you've been trying to get away from me
But you just don't know what to say to me
I just gotta do what I think I'm meant to
Everything I said is true in that text I sent you
So if you ain't gon' be my boo, then just do you
I'm smoking blunts, like they cigarettes
I still ain't shit, I ain't gotten any bigger yet
But that factor ain't something that really matters to me
Ain't nothing to think about when I'm chilling, smoking my weed
I burn it down, and then proceed to seek out all my hopes and dreams
The future holds itself so it ain't really what it seems
If I can't get to where I want, I'll be pissed
I'll tie my neck up in a noose, kick the chair and slit my wrists

She makes the boys stare at her legs
It's not that I don't care, I swear you're all in my head
Playing with your hair, laying in my bed
I got some drugs on the nightstand, I feel dead

I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me too
I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me

Baby, it's no fair, girl, I'm a mess
If you drive by, I want you to stop there and give me a kiss
I remember your blonde hair
I remember your black hair
I remember your red hair from last fall
I can't forget about anything at all

She makes the boys stare at her legs
It's not that I don't care, I swear you're all in my head

I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me too
I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me


Do you remember when we were both sixteen?
You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me

I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you

Do you remember when you didn't care 'bout me?
Now I'm your everything and I've got you on your knees
I got this little problem - I might make you bleed
"So what's the problem?" - she said
"Baby, make me scream!"

I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you

Do you remember when we were both sixteen?
You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me

I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you

You were the one, I told myself
I don't even know myself
Or control my self at all

I can't tell what I want, I can't tell what you want
She can't tell what I'm on
What do you want? Let me sing you a song

[Lil Tracy:]
I wanna hold you so close like a switchblade
I really mean that, I know you don't believe it
I'm shining so hard, I know that you can see that
I'd give it up though, I swear I'd give it up though
We're moving so fast, I don't care, I wanna crash
Let our love burn, let our love burn
We're moving so fast, I don't care, I wanna crash
Let our love burn, let our love burn

[Lil Peep:]
I let the time pass too fast
I crash, you crash
You were the one, that's what I told myself
I don't even know myself
Got my back up against the wall
I let the time pass too fast
I crash, you crash
You were the one, I told myself
I don't even know myself
Or control my self at all

[Vic Fuentes:]
Baby
Pour over, tell me, are we concrete?
What would you do without my perfect company to your undressed spine?
And I can hear you...


[Lil Peep:]
Woah, yeah

[iLoveMakonnen & Lil Peep:]
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (Yeah)
When I fall apart, your needle starts my heart, oh

[iLoveMakonnen:]
Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm dreamin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want

[Lil Peep:]
Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine
'Cause I'll do it fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine but I'll do it fine

[iLoveMakonnen:]
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'

[Patrick Stump:]
I been dreamin'
Of your uniform, your uniform of non-conformity
The tears, the tears
Tears aren't strong enough, the years aren't long enough, no

[iLoveMakonnen:]
Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm dreamin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want

[Lil Peep:]
Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine
'Cause I'll do it fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine but I'll do it fine

[iLoveMakonnen:]
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain?

[Patrick Stump:]
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin', somethin' that'll never come

Call me when you're in the city again
My head just went oblivion
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
(Always on the tip of my tongue)

[iLoveMakonnen & Lil Peep:]
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
Now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
When I've been waitin' (I've been waitin')
Long for you (Long for you)

[Lil Peep:]
I wanna drink my wine, I wanna pass that by
I wanna make her cry, she wanna make me die
Apple pie, six cigarettes
And I'll cast a vibe that we can't forget

[iLoveMakonnen & Patrick Stump:]
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain

[Patrick Stump:]
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin', somethin' that'll never come

[Lil Peep & iLoveMakonnen:]
I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting (For you)
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
(I'll be waiting for you)


[Lil Peep:]
Now I'm one step closer to hell
I can feel the ghostway comin' on
Thirty bitches wanna fuck me though
Same bitches that was hatin' on my first song
Now they say they want to fuck me with my jays on
Drugs gone, probably 'cause, me and pain, took 'em off
Nobody told you I got tears on my shirt
Blame me self if you ever get hurt, somebody kill
Drugged out, plug house, try to cop another fix
Fans all up on my dick, but they don't know my government
There till I'm fuckin' rich
Lil peep, lil pain, tell 'em hoes, suck a dick
Brokeboy sad as shit, I don't really give a shit
Sellin' reggie by a brick
[?] they couldn't make me trip
They mad, they couldn't make me flip
Hit a bitch, hit a dip, nineties baby, gettin' lit
Bang, Bang, hit a lick, liquid got me ignorant

[Lil Pain:]
I'm Reggie Bush, Reggie Miller, Reggie Jackson
In my hood they call me reggie
Cause' the reggie's what I'm packin'
Sippin', trippin', trickin', smokin', thinkin', shit that you can [?]
All these tits keep overflowin', told lil peep to pass a [?]
I'm lookin' in the mirror, [?] just a stranger
I see pain, I see sorrow, I see her, I see angle
Put the [?] to my head
And this [?] in the chamber
Now my eyes are bloody red
That means all I see is danger
There's bitch inside my bed
She ain't muscle, I won't blame her
She keep cryin', I keep lyin' but the true is I won't save her
So now she hates me but that's fine, because I hate my self
The truth is I'm tryin' to save my self
Peep waddup


Spoken words were meant to last, but the picture faded fast
The words "I love you" meant so much, now not even your lips can I touch
I'll cry for another eyesore and think about our first kiss by the tree and how it meant so much to

Nobody knows the me that you do
Gonna take some getting used to
And I think I'm getting through to you
But, all that shit I put you through ain't right
And I know that I'm barely ever home
But I think of you on the road
You know, I think of you on blow
It's me, Lil Jeep, she don't keep not a memory of me
I'm a creep, I'm a freak
That's why nobody's friends with me
I used to wait in my room for a single sign from you
Said "I hate you" 'cause I knew that you would never love me too

Ya got one more chance at a night like this (Yeah, yeah)

One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick

And that's real shit (real), we keep it real, bitch (real)
I'm a goth boy, kinda like my whole clique
You a bad one (true), we should have fun
Let's fuck in the all-black Benz truck (skrrr, skrr)
Six racks on (Peep), six packs gone (sheesh)
I'm a bad boy, we ain't gonna last long (nah)
I could make you (damn), I could break you (yeah)
Baby, think of all the places I can take you

What's your age, boo? I'm a jit still
I'mma die young, I'ma get killed
What's your age, boo? I'm a jit still
I'mma die young, baby, I'ma get killed, aye

One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick

[Lil Tracy:]
I can see the future I see paparazzi
Bad bitch riding on me rolling off the molly
That's your girl? Wait, hold up she ain't let me know it
Instagram, she posting photos just hoping I notice
Step in the club, they tryna get cameras in focus
I'm a vampire, I do not like the light on me
Fuck a friend, fuck a homie
I'm all by my lonely
Kush smoking, wine pouring at four in the morning
Peep and Tracy, two Mercedes, we race to the castle
No new friends, I feel like Drake baby I'm such a asshole
Break the cocaine off the brick and put it in her asshole
Vampire in the moonlight counting up the pesos

[Lil Peep:]
Blowing kisses in the wind
I'ma show her how I swim when the lights get dim

We just met on meeting ends

[Horse Head:]
I think about the times we could have had it all
I was in the back then, now I'm in the spotlight
Remember last fall? We could have had it all
But it's alright (but it's alright)

I was in the back then, now I'm in the spotlight
Remember last fall? We could have had it all
But it's alright (but it's alright)

[Lil Peep:]
You got my number yet? Six hundred sixty-six
Diamond rings, I'm a devil with some angel wings
I know a lot of shit, I don't ever talk shit
Lil Peep, big dick, ask my ex bitch
I've been through a lot of shit, it got me flexing
I've been through a lot of shit, so it got me sexting
Got sucked up twice in the same night
Call my baby on the west, catch a late flight
She just hang tight, I know a lot of girls like you
But my world falls down when I fight you
Beside you, can I remind you?
I wanna die too, I wanna die too

[Horse Head:]

[Lil Tracy:]
Clinically depressed gang, GothBoiClique
Wine in my chalice, take a hundred sips
Hundred girls on my dick, but I just want you
Vampire bite your neck, blood on my lip
French kiss, baby now you're one of us
Now you speak my language, they can't understand us
I'm hot, coming up like the sunrise
But I feel most alive, in the moonlight

Waitin' for my death, while I count some tens
Shawty layin' on my chest in the back of the Benz
I can see you fakin', why you playin' pretend?
I don't even know you, but you act like we're friends?
She ain’t gonna meet another one like me
Puts you to the ground while you kept walkin'
Yeah, it say "Gucci" on my plain white tee
That's a grown man flex, stop playin' with me

I'm beggin' for your touch, I'm beggin' for your touch tonight
I'm beggin' for your touch, I'm beggin' for your touch


We could run away

If you had to wait, would you stick around?
We are not the same
If you couldn't tell

I'm bout' to give her everything she ever wanted and more
What I deliver, it's something that can't be bought at the store
I'm tryna bring you with me, baby, while I'm finding myself
That feeling when you kiss me tells me I don't need no one else
I had to lose my mind a couple times to find out it's you
I had to run around the world, girl, just to be here, it's true
These other women don't got nothing on the way that she moves
Let's pick up right where we left off last night, inside of my room

When the time come
I'll be right here
Sippin' liquor with a grin on my face, for you
I got nothing left to keep me awake
I don't got no better thing to do than sit here and wait
For you
For you
For you
For you

Sometimes life gets fucked up, that's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch, I still do those same drugs

Sometimes life gets fucked up, that's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch, I still do those same drugs

That we used to do, I was used to you
What have you been through? she asked me
Every fuckin kind of abuse
If you loved me too, you would give me you
Lock me in your room, don't tell me the truth
Everything you said (everything you said)
Stayed inside my head (stayed inside my head)
All the shit you said, all the blood I bled

Sometimes life gets fucked up, that's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch, I still do those same drugs

Sometimes life gets fucked up, that's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch, I still do those same drugs


Loving you is like a fairytale
I just can't pick up the phone again
This time I'll be on my own, my friend
One more time, I'm all alone again

Sex with you is like I'm dreaming, and
I just wanna hear you scream again
Now you're gone, I can't believe that
Time I spent with you deceiving me
I don't care if you believe in me
I still wonder why you're leaving me
I don't care if you believe me
I still wonder why you tease me

And if I'm taking this the wrong way
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever you're thinking
It's when you put me in the spotlight (spotlight)
I hope you know I'm faded, all of this liquor I'm drinking
And if I'm taking this the wrong way (wrong way)
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever you're thinking
It's when you put me in the spotlight (spotlight)
It's when you put me in the spotlight (spotlight)

When the moon hit your skin, I could see you and him
Not you and me, yeah, but it's just you and me, yeah
When the sun shines above, you wake up with the one you love
Not you and me, yeah, but it's just you and me, yeah
(All alone again)

Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous
So much more than perfect (yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it

Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me
Look at my face, when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week

That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings

None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea

Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week

Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason

Just the cracks of my heart, I've been feeling lonely
Silver chains in my heart, I've been caught up

Silver chains in my heart, like I was so down, like I was so down

Baby, this is the last time
You were nothin' more to me
Than when you loved me in my dreams
Still dreamin' about you
You know I'm crazy about you
There is nothin' more to me than you
I died that day you left my room in tears

This is the last time
Me and you are a past time
And I know that you and I both wish this didn't have to end like this
But, it's that time
Put the kid on the map time
I just finished the last line
Can't believe it's the last night, the last fight with you

I remember the first time
Baby, this is the last time
You were nothin' more to me
Then when you loved me in my dreams
Still dreamin' about you
You know I'm crazy about you

She ends up in a better place inside when she get high

Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind

Pour that drip up in my faygo
In my city y'all gotta say so
I was just talking to Fredo
Then I woke up he was gone
All my friends are really dead
Still hear their voices in my head
These days it's hard to sleep alone
I beg my baby, please don't go
Please don't go
I can handle my rivals but can't fight these demons alone
Please don't go
All these fakes, all these snakes in the grass gotta keep it cut low
Keep the circle small, stand tall through it all
Praying I don't fall, no they'd rather see me long gone
